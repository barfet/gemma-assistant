**1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the requirements for building a general-purpose AI assistant chatbot for mobile platforms (iOS and Android), powered by Google's Gemma 3 large language model. The primary goal is to create a highly personalized, context-aware, and responsive assistant that seamlessly integrates with core device features like calendar and health tracking. Key features include customizable voice, name, and avatar; real-time voice and text interaction; and robust integration with device APIs via a tool-using agent framework. The solution leverages Gemma 3's capabilities for on-device efficiency, long context handling, and multimodal potential, aiming to provide users with a helpful, engaging, and private mobile AI experience. Success will be measured by user engagement, task completion rates, response latency, and user satisfaction with personalization and core functionalities.

**7. Architecture & Technical Approach**

Based on the System Architecture Overview and related sections:

*   **Overall Architecture:** Modular, client-server hybrid. Primary interaction path aims for on-device processing for speed and privacy.
*   **Client (Mobile App - iOS/Android):**
    *   UI Layer: Chat interface, personalization settings, avatar display.
    *   Interaction Logic: Manages STT input, TTS output, calls to the Agent Core.
    *   Agent Core (On-Device):
        *   Orchestration: LangChain/LangGraph agent managing conversation flow and tool use.
        *   LLM Inference: Runs a quantized Gemma 3 variant (e.g., 1B/4B) using an optimized runtime (TF Lite, Core ML via converters, Google AI Edge LLM API, potentially GGML/llama.cpp). Utilizes mobile CPU/GPU/NPU.
        *   Tools: Local implementations interacting with device APIs (Calendar, HealthKit/Connect, etc.).
        *   Memory: Short-term conversation buffer, long-term user profile database (secure local storage).
        *   RAG (Optional On-Device): Local vector store for personal notes/docs if implemented.
    *   Cloud Connector: Handles requests forwarded to the cloud backend when necessary (complex tasks, user preference, on-device failure).
*   **Backend (Cloud - Optional/Hybrid):**
    *   API Gateway: Manages requests from mobile clients, handles authentication/rate limiting.
    *   Inference Service: Hosts larger Gemma 3 variants (e.g., 12B/27B) on GPU instances (e.g., Vertex AI Endpoints, self-hosted Kubernetes with GPUs). Uses optimized serving frameworks like vLLM for throughput and low latency. Stateless design preferred.
    *   RAG Service (Cloud): Access to larger vector databases or external knowledge APIs if needed.
    *   (Potentially) Fine-tuning Service: Infrastructure for running the MCP training jobs.
*   **Key Technologies:**

    *   Agent Framework: LangChain, LangGraph.
    *   Observability: LangSmith.
    *   Fine-Tuning: Hugging Face PEFT (LoRA, QLoRA, AdaLoRA), Hugging Face TRL (PPO).
    *   Mobile Inference: TensorFlow Lite, Core ML, Google AI Edge SDKs, potentially GGML/llama.cpp wrappers.
    *   Cloud Serving: Vertex AI, Kubernetes, Docker, vLLM.
    *   Data Pipeline: Kubeflow Pipelines / Vertex AI Pipelines, Cloud Storage, Experiment Tracking (W&B/MLflow).
    *   Vector DB (for RAG): ChromaDB, FAISS (on-device or cloud).
    *   Voice I/O: Native platform STT/TTS, potentially Coqui TTS/STT or ElevenLabs (cloud).

**8. Data Pipeline & Tooling**

Based on the Data Pipeline (MCP) and Tools sections:

*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Anonymized conversation logs (user query, assistant response, tool calls) with user consent.
    *   Explicit user feedback (thumbs up/down, ratings, corrections).
    *   App analytics (feature usage, session length, latency metrics).
*   **Data Storage & Cleaning:**
    *   Secure cloud storage (e.g., GCS, S3) for raw and processed data.
    *   Automated pipelines for cleaning (removing PII, filtering sensitive content), formatting (e.g., JSONL for training), and segmentation (e.g., by task type, success/failure).
*   **Labeling & Annotation:**
    *   Leverage user feedback directly (e.g., thumbs down indicates a negative sample).
    *   Internal team annotation for quality assessment, error categorization, and creating preference pairs (for DPO/RLHF).
    *   Potential use of AI-based labeling (RLAIF) using a powerful model (e.g., GPT-4, larger Gemma) to generate preference data at scale, carefully validated.
*   **Continuous Training (MCP):**
    *   Automated pipeline (e.g., Kubeflow/Vertex AI Pipelines) triggered by data volume or schedule.
    *   Steps: Data Extraction -> Preprocessing -> Fine-tuning (PEFT/RL) -> Evaluation (on holdout sets, benchmark tasks) -> Safety Checks -> Model Registration.
    *   Experiment tracking (MLflow, W&B) to log runs, parameters, and metrics.
*   **Deployment & Monitoring:**
    *   CI/CD practices for deploying pipeline updates and new model versions (adapters or full models).
    *   Use LangSmith for production monitoring of agent behavior, latency, error rates, and quality drift.
    *   Feedback loop: Monitoring insights and user feedback inform subsequent training data curation and model improvements.
*   **Key Tooling:** Gemma 3 checkpoints, Hugging Face (Transformers, PEFT, Datasets, Accelerate, TRL), LangChain/LangGraph/LangSmith, Mobile Inference Libraries (TF Lite, Core ML, etc.), Cloud Platform Services (Vertex AI, K8s), Pipeline Orchestrators (Kubeflow, Vertex Pipelines), Experiment Tracking (W&B, MLflow), Vector DBs (Chroma, FAISS).

**9. Personalization Strategies**

*   **User Configuration:** Provide clear settings within the app for users to:
    *   Set the assistant's name.
    *   Choose a voice (from predefined list, potentially platform voice clone).
    *   Select an avatar (from predefined list).
    *   Adjust personality traits (e.g., sliders for formality/humor).
*   **Profile Management:**
    *   Store user preferences (name, voice choice, avatar choice, personality settings) and learned attributes (e.g., favorite sports team, common query times) in a secure, encrypted local database on the user's device.
*   **Inference Time Personalization:**
    *   Inject user preferences and learned attributes into the Gemma 3 model's context/prompt at the start of each session or interaction (e.g., "You are Alex, a helpful assistant for John. John prefers concise answers and follows the Lakers."). This leverages Gemma's large context window without needing per-user models.
    *   Use the selected voice ID when calling the TTS engine.
    *   Display the chosen avatar in the UI.
    *   Use RAG with the local profile database to retrieve relevant user facts if needed for a query.
*   **Privacy:** Explicitly state that personalization data is stored locally and not used for cross-user analysis unless anonymized and opted-in for general model improvement. Per-user fine-tuning is avoided to maintain privacy and scalability.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:** Leverage integrations (e.g., Health tracker) to provide contextual, personalized suggestions or insights in real-time (e.g., "Low sleep detected, consider an earlier night?"). Requires background monitoring capabilities and user permission.

**10. Deployment & Release Plan**

*   **Target Platforms:** iOS (Target version TBD), Android (Target SDK version TBD).
*   **Environment Strategy:** Hybrid deployment.
    *   **On-Device:** Core model and logic bundled with the app or downloaded post-install. Optimized for low latency and offline use. Handles most common interactions.
    *   **Cloud:** Backend service hosted on a scalable cloud platform (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) for heavier tasks, access to larger models, or when the user opts-in.
*   **Release Phases:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Internal Alpha):** Core chatbot, basic personalization (name), initial Calendar integration. Focus on stability and core LLM performance.
    *   **Phase 2 (Closed Beta):** Add voice personalization, avatar, Health integration, improved context handling, initial MCP deployment. Gather user feedback on features and performance.

    *   **Phase 4 (General Availability - GA):** Full feature set, stable performance, ongoing improvement via MCP.
*   **Versioning & Updates:**
    *   App updates delivered via standard App Store / Google Play processes.
    *   Model/Adapter updates can be bundled with app updates or delivered via background download (e.g., fetched from CDN/HF Hub) to allow for faster iteration cycles, especially for PEFT adapters. Implement robust version checking and fallback mechanisms.
    *   Cloud backend updates use blue-green or canary deployment strategies.

**11. Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

*   **Risk: Privacy Breach / Data Leak:** (High Impact)
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize on-device processing; strong encryption for data at rest and in transit; rigorous anonymization for any cloud data; regular security audits; clear user consent mechanisms.
